This code sets up Terraform to use AWS as the cloud provider and creates a VPC, internet gateway, 4 subnets (2 public and 2 private), 1 EC2 instance in each of these public subnets, and sets the properties for each resource. The public subnets have public IPs enabled, while the private subnets do not. The code also assigns CIDR blocks and availability zones to each subnet and assigns names to each resource using tags.

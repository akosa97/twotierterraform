# twotierterraform
I'll be using Terraform to architect a 2-Tier Architecture that consists of the following: A VPC with 2 public subnets and 2 private subnets. A load balancer that will direct traffic to the public subnets and 1 EC2 instance in each public subnet. An RDS MySQL instance in one of the subnets.
